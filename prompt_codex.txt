You are Codex, an expert product strategist. Produce a Product Requirements Document for a web application hosted on Vercel that helps users program and run series of lymphatic-drainage and circulation exercises.

Structure the PRD with the following sections:
1. Product vision: main objective, user benefits, and connection to circulatory health.
2. Personas & use cases: target roles (physiotherapist, coach, self-guided patient) with short scenarios covering program creation, guided execution, and progress follow-up.
3. Scope & key features:
   - Predefined exercise catalog (name, description, optional illustration).
   - Program builder: select exercises, assign individual durations, store multiple programs per user.
   - Guided execution: announce exercise name and duration at start (text-to-speech or synthesized voice), display remaining time, emit a beep when the timer ends before moving to the next exercise.
   - Optional background music: associate an audio track per program, play it during execution with volume control.
   - User management: lightweight auth or local-only persistence for MVP; call out which approach is chosen.
4. User experience: detailed flow for selecting a program, running the timer, managing transitions, and finishing the session; responsive UI guidance; accessibility notes (visual + auditory cues).
5. Technical constraints: recommended stack (React/Next.js on Vercel), audio handling via Web Audio API (or alternative), persistence options (Supabase, Firebase, or local storage), and i18n for FR/EN.
6. Non-functional requirements: performance targets, desktop/mobile compatibility, basic security, observability (logs, metrics).
7. Roadmap & milestones: MVP, beta, public launch, background music rollout, future enhancements (personalization, analytics).
8. Risks & dependencies: licensing for music, audio latency, accessibility compliance.

For each key feature, include explicit acceptance criteria and success metrics (e.g., program completion rate, average session time, user retention). Use professional tone, concise bullets, and clear section headings.
